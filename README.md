# Calculator

## Kompletteringsuppgift:
Bygg en kalkylator efter 7 user-stories.
### User-stories:
There should be a graphical interface for the calculator, including a body, a place for buttons and a screen.

There should be 6 buttons named “A, B, C, D, E” and “Store” where the user can store the latest expression result in one of the five letters.
To store, the user presses “Store” followed by a letter.
To use a stored number, the user simply presses that letter.

I want to have clickable buttons representing +, -, x and / which will appear on the screen when clicked to form expressions together with the numbers. E.g. Clicking “3”, “+” and “4” should write that combination as “3+4” somewhere on the screen.

There should be a “Clear”-button which removes all the characters that has been input and resets the calculator state.

I want to have clickable buttons that represent the numbers 0-9 which will make that number appear on the screen next to the last clicked number.

There should be an undo button that removes the last character that was
clicked on.

There should be a “Timer”-button, which will start a timer that counts seconds and minutes up from 00:00. When the user clicks the button again the timer should stop.
